    // Vanilla only fills an armor stand from the hotbar (aim at it, press the item's number) and
    // empties it with Use, which drops every armor piece on the ground at once because the helmet,
    // chest, legs, cape and belt slots share one hover zone. This opens the stand as a small chest
    // instead: one cell per slot, filled by dragging from the inventory and emptied with Take all.
    // It also adds a swap that trades the stand's armor for what the player is wearing. Everything
    // is client-side: the stand keeps its items in the same ZDO keys vanilla uses, so players
    // without the mod see the same stand and can still use it the vanilla way.
